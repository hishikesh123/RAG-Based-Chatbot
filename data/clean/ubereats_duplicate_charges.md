# I Think I Was Charged More Than Once

## Promo Code Didn’t Apply
If you are experiencing an issue applying a promo code, click on the link provided in the app.

## Extra or Duplicate Charge
What looks like an extra or duplicate charge is usually an **authorization hold**.  

- Uber may apply a temporary authorization hold for the order amount in advance on your account’s payment method.  
- This ensures your card has sufficient funds.  
- It **does not result in a duplicate charge**.  

Uber refunds this hold once your order is complete, but it can take up to **10 business days** to drop.  
- It may take longer with **Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal** payment methods.  
- For exact processing times, please contact your **bank**.

## Signs of an Authorization Hold
- The charge appears as **pending**.  
- The charge equals the **order amount**.  

## Things to Double-Check
- Is a **friend or family member** using your account?  
- Is the charge from **two different orders**?  

## Important Note
Uber cannot expedite the release of an authorization hold.  
If you continue to have issues, contact your **bank directly**.  

If none of the above apply, you may be asked to enter your details into the in-app form.
