# How to Add a Tip

You can add a tip for your delivery person in **three ways**.  

---

## 1. Before Placing Your Order
- After selecting your items, follow the checkout prompts.  
- On the final screen before placing your order, you’ll see the **tip screen**.  
- Select a tip amount/percentage, or tap **Other** to enter a custom amount.  
- You can change this tip amount **up to one hour after delivery**.  

---

## 2. After Delivery
- Once your order is delivered, you’re prompted to **rate your experience** and **add a tip**.  
- If you add a tip after delivery, Uber Eats will send you an **updated receipt** including the new tip amount.  
- You **cannot change this tip amount** after adding it.

## 3. In Your Order History
- You can add a tip to a completed order for **up to 90 days** after delivery.  
- In the Uber Eats app:  
  1. Tap **Orders** in the bottom menu bar.  
  2. Select **Past Orders**, then choose the order.  
  3. Rate your order, select a tip amount, and tap **Submit**.  
- You **cannot change this tip amount** once it’s added.
