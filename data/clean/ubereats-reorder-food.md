# How Can I Reorder Food I’ve Ordered Before?

To reorder a past order:  
1. From the **main screen**, tap **Account**.  
2. Select **Orders** and find the order you’d like to have again.  
3. Tap **Reorder**.  

This will add the same list of items to your cart, so you can do a **final review** before placing your order again.
