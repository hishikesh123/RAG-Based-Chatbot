# Can I Order Multiple Meals, or From Multiple Restaurants, in the Same Order?

You **cannot order items from more than one restaurant in the same order**.

## Ordering From Multiple Restaurants
- If you’d like to order from multiple restaurants, you can **place another order** from a different restaurant while your current order is being prepared and delivered.  
- Keep in mind: each separate order will include its **own delivery fee**.
