# Uber Community Guidelines — Australia & New Zealand

These guidelines help keep experiences **safe, respectful, and positive** across the Uber Marketplace Platform (Uber Rides, Uber Eats, merchants, businesses, and interactions with Uber staff). Some rules also apply to conduct **outside** the platform if it threatens platform safety.

---

## Pillars
1. **Treat everyone with respect**
2. **Help keep one another safe**
3. **Follow the law**
4. **Your feedback matters**

---

## Treat Everyone with Respect

### Physical contact
- Don’t touch others (exceptions: requested assistance, e.g., Uber Assist).
- Violence or intent to harm is prohibited.

### Inappropriate conduct & sexual misconduct
- Respect personal space and privacy; avoid personal/sexual topics.
- **No sexual conduct** of any kind (no-sex rule), explicit comments, gestures, or indecent material.

### Threatening or rude behaviour
- No aggressive, confrontational, harassing, or graphic content sharing.

### Post-trip contact
- Contact ends when the trip/delivery is complete (except to return a lost item).

### Non-discrimination
- No denial of service, ratings bias, or destination discrimination based on protected traits.
- Drivers must comply with disability laws (service animals, assistive devices).

### Property damage
- Never damage vehicles, equipment, premises, or items (you’re responsible for cleaning/repairs).

---

## Help Keep One Another Safe

### Account integrity
- **No account sharing.** Complete your own trips/deliveries; follow delegation policies where applicable.

### Age restrictions
- Must be **18+** to hold an Uber account or receive unaccompanied rides/deliveries.
- School deliveries go via reception unless directed otherwise.

### Extra passengers / non-account riders
- Only the driver, requesting rider, and rider’s guests ride. Account holder is responsible for their party.

### Accurate vehicle information
- Use only approved vehicles; keep licence/registration/ID up to date.

### Seat belts & helmets
- Seat belts required for **all** occupants.
- Wear helmets on bikes/motorcycles/scooters as required by law.

### Dash cams
- Local consent laws may apply; recordings may be submitted to Uber per law and policies.
- No sharing/streaming recordings publicly.

### Be alert & maintain vehicles
- Drive/rest safely; maintain vehicles to safety standards; remedy recalls.

### Share the road
- Look out for all road users; manage risks like **dog bites/animals** at delivery locations.

### Public emergencies
- Uber may limit access to preserve safety per authority guidance.

## Additional Guidelines for Delivery (Uber Eats, Direct, Connect)

### Merchants — food orders
- Hold valid licences; follow food safety laws and best practices.
- Use tamper-evident packaging; act responsibly on allergy/dietary info.

### Merchants/Senders — non-food orders
- Package appropriately; size/weight must be safe to handle.

### Delivery people
- Follow merchant delivery guidelines and safety standards.
- Don’t tamper with/open packaging; insulated bags recommended where lawful.

### FSANZ considerations
- Keep cold food cool; clean vehicles; prevent contamination.

### Safe pickup spaces (merchants)
- Provide a safe, welcoming pickup area; manage incidents.

### Alcohol delivery
- Comply with age (18+), ID checks, intoxication rules, and local prohibitions.

### Positive experience & metrics (merchants)
- Fulfil correctly, minimize prep/handoff times, stay responsive; poor metrics may trigger action.

### Prohibited items
- Only list permitted items; illegal/unsafe items are banned (see AU/NZ lists).

## Follow the Law

- No criminal or unsafe activity; obey traffic/airport/health directions.
- Keep licences/insurance/registrations current; respect parking and road rules.
- Riders/recipients: don’t interfere with vehicle operation; don’t request illegal actions.
- Bikes/scooters: follow local cycling laws.
- **Car seats:** riders supply and install when required; drivers may decline if unsafe.
- **Service animals/assistive devices:** drivers must not deny service; only lawful questions allowed.
- **Drugs & alcohol:** never use while driving/delivering; report suspected impairment.
- **Weapons ban:** no weapons where prohibited; see Firearms Prohibition Policy.
- **Fraud:** no deception, dummy accounts, false charges/fees, manipulating app/GPS, or theft of orders.
- **Street hails/off-platform pickups:** prohibited; no cash payments off-platform.
- **IP/brand misuse:** use only authorized Uber-branded items when required by law.

---

## Your Feedback & Ratings

- Report issues via **Help** in-app or help.uber.com; call emergency services if in danger.
- Ratings system promotes accountability; each city has a minimum average rating.
- Low ratings may lead to loss of access; some drivers may regain access via approved courses.

---

## Delivery/Order/Trip Acceptance

- If you don’t wish to accept requests, go **offline** (drivers/delivery people) or **pause orders** (merchants).
- Repeated declines may trigger temporary logouts (you can log back in anytime).

---

## Enforcement

- Violations of terms, policies, or guidelines can result in **loss of access** (potentially across all accounts).
- Uber may investigate, place holds, or deactivate during reviews; cooperates with law enforcement per policy.
- Regulatory non-compliance may require removal of access.
- Background/MVR checks are required; failures may lead to loss of access.
