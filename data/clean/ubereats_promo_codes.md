# Promo Code Didn’t Apply

Uber Eats offers special discounts to customers via promotional codes. This page is for reporting issues with Uber Eats promos.

If you have an issue with your **Uber Pass discount**, please use the link provided in the app.

## Managing Promo Codes
You can add new promo codes and view your active, redeemed, and expired promo codes in the Uber Eats app:

1. Tap **Account**  
2. Tap **Promotions**  
3. Tap **Enter code** in the top right-hand corner to add a new promo code  

You can also enter a promo code **before submitting an order**:  
- When viewing your cart, scroll to the bottom of the page  
- Select **Add Promo Code**

## Promo Code Usage Guidelines
- Only **one discount** can be applied per trip/order.  
- You must select the discount **before** you complete the order.  
- Your own referral code **cannot** be applied to your account.  
- Discounts are unique to each user—you may not receive the same promos as others.  
- Eligibility is communicated via app or email.  
- You cannot apply a code that was sent to another user’s account.  
- If you forgot to add the promo code to the order, you can use it on your **next eligible order** (if it hasn’t expired).

## Promo Code Value
- Promo codes only apply in their **original currency**.  
- Value applies to **one trip/order only**.  
- Excess value does **not carry over** to another order.  

## Still Having Issues?
If your issue isn’t resolved by the guidelines above, report your experience through the app so Uber Eats support can investigate further.
