# Missing Utensils or Condiments

Restaurants no longer automatically include single-use items (utensils, napkins, straws, condiments) in your order to help reduce unnecessary landfill waste.  

---

## How to Request Utensils or Condiments
- Tick the **“Request utensils, etc.”** box before checkout.  
- You can also **add a note** to the restaurant indicating which items (and how many) you need.  

---

## If Items Were Missing
- If you asked for utensils or condiments but didn’t receive them, provide **feedback to the restaurant** by rating them after your order:  
  1. Tap **Orders** (receipt icon) in the Uber Eats app.  
  2. Tap **Rate Order** next to the delivery confirmation.

## Still Need Utensils?
If you still require utensils or condiments, you may reach out to the **restaurant directly**.
