# How to Create a Meal Plan

A **Meal Plan** is a comprehensive order management experience where creators can set up and manage multiple **group orders** (recurring or as-needed).  

- **Participants** can join existing orders, add items individually, and follow the schedule/store chosen by the creator.  
- Only the **creator** can create new orders in the Meal Plan.  
- Creators decide if participants pay separately or if the creator pays for everyone.  
- Creators can **cancel scheduled orders** before deadlines or create new orders with different stores.
