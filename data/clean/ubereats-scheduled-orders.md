# Can I Order Food for a Set Time?

Yes â€” you can place a **scheduled order**.  
Scheduled orders make it easy to get your favourite food delivered at a time that suits you.  

---

## How to Schedule an Order
1. Add your items to the **cart**.  
2. Tap **Go to checkout**.  
3. Under **Delivery Options**, tap **Schedule**.  
4. Select your preferred time.  

ðŸ‘‰ Orders can be scheduled up to **one week in advance**.  

---

## Limitations
- You can only schedule orders when the **restaurant is open**.  
- If the merchant is closed, try again during their open hours.
