# Authorization Holds – FAQ

## What is an Authorization Hold?
When you place an Uber Eats order, you may receive a notification from your bank about an Uber charge.  
Uber may apply a **temporary authorization hold** for the value of the order in advance.  
- This is standard e-commerce practice to ensure your card has sufficient funds.  
- It does **not** result in a duplicate charge on your card.

## How will I know if a transaction is an Authorization Hold?
Signs that your charge is likely a hold:  
- The charge appears as **pending**.  
- The charge shows as **“Uber Temporary Hold”** in your account’s payment method.  
- The charge is **equal to the order amount**.

## How long does it take before the Authorization Hold is refunded?
- Depends on your bank’s policy.  
- In some cases, it appears within **minutes**.  
- Other transactions may take up to **10 business days or longer**.

## What if the Authorization Hold doesn’t get refunded after 10 business days?
- Contact your **bank directly** for assistance.  
- Your bank can provide details about their hold process and exact timelines.  
- If the transaction seems **not** to be an authorization hold, select the option that best matches your issue in the app.
