# Uber Eats Cancellation Policy

In this Uber Eats cancellation policy, “Non-Restaurant Food Items” refers to non-restaurant food items including, for example, items from grocery, convenience, alcohol, specialty goods such as florists or butchers, pharmacy and/or pet stores.

## Cancelling Restaurant Orders
If you purchase items from a merchant (other than a merchant who sells Non-Restaurant Food Items) you may cancel your order at any time.  
- If a merchant has not yet accepted your order, you can cancel at any time without incurring a charge.  
- If a merchant has accepted your order and you cancel 2 minutes or more after placing your order, you will incur a cancellation charge (no more than the full price of your ordered items).  
- If you cancel after the delivery has begun, you will also be charged the full price for any Uber Eats delivery services.

## Cancelling Non-Restaurant Food Orders
If you purchase items from a merchant who sells Non-Restaurant Food Items:  
- You may cancel your order at any time.  
- Once delivery has begun, you will no longer be able to cancel your order without incurring a charge, which will be no more than the full price for your ordered items and the full price for any Uber Eats delivery services.

## How to Cancel
To cancel your order, tap **Cancel Order** in the order tracking screen.  
If you have any issues or concerns regarding your order, please contact our support team.  
Uber Eats may, in its sole discretion, waive in part or full, an applicable cancellation charge in certain circumstances (via the customer support service).

## Why Was I Charged When I Cancelled?
- If a merchant has accepted your order and you cancel 2 minutes or more after placing it → cancellation charge (up to the full item cost).  
- If you cancel after delivery has begun → charged for full order + delivery services.  
- For Non-Restaurant Food merchants → once delivery has begun, you will be charged full order + delivery services.

## Authorization Holds
- All orders place a pre-authorization hold on your account to check available funds.  
- If your order is cancelled and eligible for a refund, the authorization hold is released immediately.  
- Depending on your bank, funds usually return within 5–10 business days, sometimes longer.  
- Uber Eats cannot expedite the release; contact your bank if issues arise.
