# How to Place a Business Group Order

When you initiate a **business group order**, you’ll receive a **shareable link** that allows multiple people to add items to the same order.  
You can either **pay for everyone** or allow each guest to **pay for their own share**.  

⚠️ **Note:** A **business profile** is required to place a business group order. Without it, you won’t be able to bill meals to your organization’s payment method.

## Creating a Business Profile
1. Open the **Uber Eats app** and tap **Account** (bottom right).  
2. Tap **Business Preferences**.  
3. Tap **Start using Uber for business** or **Add another business profile**.  
4. Follow the prompts to create your profile.  
5. *(Optional)* Select your company’s **expense provider** to enable automatic receipt forwarding.  
   - You’ll receive an email to complete the linking process.  
   - You can also add an expense provider later (see support article).
