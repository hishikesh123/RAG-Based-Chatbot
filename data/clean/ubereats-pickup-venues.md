# Ordering Pickup at Venues

---

## Can I Place an Order at a Venue?
- At select **stadiums, airports, or music venues**, you can place **pickup orders** from merchants within your location.  
- To check availability, open the app and see if your **venue is listed on the homepage**.  

---

## Can I Order From Outside the Venue?
- **No.** Once you’re inside the venue, the app will only show merchants available for pickup **within your location**.  

---

## How Will I Know Where to Order From?
- Before ordering, Uber Eats may ask for **additional location information** (e.g., your section or gate).  
- This helps identify merchants closest to you.  
- You’ll get a **notification** when your food is ready for pickup.  
- Head to the merchant’s location to collect your order.
